What you will need to do this:
A computer (to download, run, and setup)
A iso copy of a Linux operating system
The program Rufus (can be downloaded for free)
A USB memory card (16 GB or higher)

1. Download an iso copy of a Linux OS, (although you can choose any you prefer, I recommend Ubuntu, can be found here: https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

2. Download the latest copy of Rufus (can be downloaded from the following website:  https://rufus.akeo.ie/)

3. Plug in the usb drive into computer

4. Run Rufus
In the Device menu, pick your usb device you want to use
In the “New volume label” write a name you would like to use
Make sure “Create a bootable disk using” is checked
Select the drop down menu to the right of “Create a bootable disk using” and make sure it says “ISO Image”
To the right of that click the small disk icon and select your ISO image you downloaded
Click “Start” and the program will start formatting your usb, once it is done you are finished

5. To run the usb you must change the boot options on the computer to boot from the usb stick
