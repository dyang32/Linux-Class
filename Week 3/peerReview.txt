# Peer Review
# Don Yang
# I choose to review KiaSia's script

# For some reason I cannot run the script but when I input the individual commands it seems to work.
# The three commands that she gives in her script seem to work just fine.
# She gives a good description of what each command does. Everything looks excellent.







#!/bin/bash

#simple script to find /disk through cmd line

#list contents of directory and pipe to more, search for /disk

ls /dev | more

#change directory

cd /dev/disk

#explore disks. should show all disks and external drives (usb/cd)

ls -F /dev/disk/by-id
